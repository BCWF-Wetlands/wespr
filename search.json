However, indicators yet calculated. Now, can calculate indicator scores calc_indicators() function. must assign output function back original wesp_site object, updates indicators calculated values: view site object , can see calculated indicator scores. probably want get indicator scores usable object. can get_indicator_scores(), gives us data.frame: Similarly, can extract original responses get_responses(): can also get data.frame derived values, values calculated responses, used inputs many indicators.","code":"library(wespr) Question,1,2,3,4,5,6 F1_1,1,0,1,1,1,2 F1_2,0,3,3,2,0,2 F1_3,1,0,3,1,1,1 F1_4,1,4,1,1,1,3 F1_5,1,0,1,1,1,0 F1_6,1,1,1,1,1,4 F2_A1,0,0,0,0,0,1 F2_A2,0,0,0,0,0,0 F2_B1,0,1,0,0,0,0 F2_B2,1,0,1,1,1,0 wesp_file <- system.file(\"input_data/wetFlat_20240130.csv\", package = \"wespr\") wesp_data <- load_wesp_data(wesp_file)  head(wesp_data) #> # A tibble: 6 × 102 #>   q_no  response_no site_1 site_2 site_3 site_4 site_5 site_6 site_7 site_8 #>   <chr> <chr>       <chr>   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  #> 1 F1    1           0           1 1      1      2      1      4      1      #> 2 F1    2           3           3 2      0      2      0      0      0      #> 3 F1    3           0           3 1      1      1      1      3      1      #> 4 F1    4           4           1 1      1      3      1      0      0      #> 5 F1    5           0           1 1      1      0      1      1      0      #> 6 F1    6           1           1 1      1      4      3      0      0      #> # ℹ 92 more variables: site_9 <chr>, site_10 <chr>, site_11 <chr>, #> #   site_12 <chr>, site_13 <chr>, site_14 <chr>, site_15 <chr>, site_16 <chr>, #> #   site_17 <chr>, site_18 <chr>, site_19 <chr>, site_20 <chr>, site_21 <chr>, #> #   site_22 <chr>, site_23 <chr>, site_24 <chr>, site_25 <chr>, site_26 <chr>, #> #   site_27 <chr>, site_28 <chr>, site_29 <chr>, site_30 <chr>, site_31 <chr>, #> #   site_32 <chr>, site_33 <chr>, site_34 <chr>, site_35 <chr>, site_36 <chr>, #> #   site_37 <chr>, site_38 <chr>, site_39 <chr>, site_40 <chr>, … site <- as.wesp_site(wesp_data, site = 1) #> Questions F43, F44, F50 do not appear to have been filled out. #>  Please ensure this is valid. site #> A wesp_site object #>  #> Site:  site_1  #>  #> Incomplete Questions:  F43, F44, F50  #>   * Please ensure that it is valid to leave these questions unanswered. #>  #> Derived values: #>   *  AllWater = 0 #>   *  NeverWater = 0 #>   *  NoSeasonal = 0 #>   *  NoPersis = 0 #>   *  TempWet = 0 #>   *  AllPermW = 0 #>   *  HiFlucW = 0 #>   *  TooShallow = 0 #>   *  NoPond = 0 #>   *  NoDeepPonded = 0 #>   *  NoOW = 0 #>   *  NoOutletX = 0 #>   *  NoOutlet = 0 #>   *  Inflow = 0 #>   *  Disturb = 0 #>   *  FishFound = 0 #>   *  Moose = 0 #>   *  Beaver = 0 #>   *  Muskrat = 0 #>   *  Bear = 0 #>   *  Caribou = 0 #>   *  NoCA = 0 #>   *  Fishless = 0 #>   *  GDeco = 0 #>   *  CMeco = 1 #>   *  SIMeco = 0 #>   *  BPeco = 0 #>   *  TPeco = 0 #>   *  OutMap = 0 #>   *  S1_sum = 2 #>   *  S1_subscore = 0.17 #>   *  S2_sum = 0 #>   *  S2_subscore = 0 #>   *  S3_sum = 0 #>   *  S3_subscore = 0 #>   *  S4_sum = 5 #>   *  S4_subscore = 0.42 #>   *  S5_sum = 0 #>   *  S5_subscore = 0 #>   *  S6_sum = 0 #>   *  S6_subscore = 0 #>  #> Indicators: #> All indicators are NULL.
